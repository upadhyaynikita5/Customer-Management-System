                A coffee shop is a warm, welcoming place where customers can relax while
                sipping teas, light eats, and a range of coffee-based beverages. Coffee shops,
                which usually stand out by an inviting environment, provide a selection of
                espresso-based beverages, such as lattes, cappuccinos, and brewed coffee, in
                addition to customization choices such as syrups, milk substitutes, and other
                items. These locations offer a cozy setting for people to relax, work, or interact in
                groups or individually. Coffee shops are popular places for study and work from
                home because many of them have Wi-Fi available.
